#Introduction
Hello! My name is *Emily Forden* and I am a 
**5th Year** in the 
[History PdD program](https://history.uchicago.edu/) 
where I study ancient Roman economics.

_Here are some interesting things about me!_
1. I got married in June!
2. I have a cat named Otho, who was a Roman Emperor. 
Here is a photo of him:

3. When I'm not studying, you can find me scuba diving! 
I'm working on becoming a dive master.

##Thoughts and Reflections
Although I found it easy to edit a clone on my computer, 
I had a really hard time getting
the document to appear in GitHub. At times, I could 
be heard muttering:
  
>I'm going to smash my computer
>like the Hulk

Thankfully, I don't think it will come to that!
