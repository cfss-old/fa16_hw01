## by Tong Ju ##

My name is Tong Ju, a student in MAPSS program. 

Before coming to Chicago, my research focused on the protein engineering and protein sulfation. Naturally, my interest in social science relies in  **sociology of science**. I intend to understand the conceptual evolution of biochemistry over history through using sociological tool.

Besides this, I am also interested in the **political sociology **, especially the historical memory of Chinese people in the  twentieth century.

*Other interests outside academic*

* reading

* guitar

* cooking

* movie
