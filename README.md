# Computing for the Social Sciences - HW1

## Student Introduction
(does this mean self-introduction?)
My name is Chih-Yu Chiang. I'm from MAPSS and intends doing the MACSS certificate. I did undergrad and first master's degree in business. After that, I worked for a video game studio, and did data-driven design works for a couple of years before coming back to this school. My education and working experience provides me a medium level of exposure to data analysis tools and some relevant programming languages such as SQL and VBA. I also have a basic level of knowledge in javascript and some other languages based on it like Nodejs and jQuery. I used them primarily for prototyping in my professional works. More information can be found on my site:

## Process of Completing the Work
1. Setting up all the things!  
Many thanks for a super detailed and clear step-by-step tutor documentation.

1. Editing the file on line.  
Open the on-line editor in GitHub, edit the text, and submit.

1. Editing the file in local.  
Pull the README file from RStudio, open the local file, see the change from the previous editing, edit the text, submit, and push onto GitHub.

1. Encountering an error  
Whenever I try to *preview* the file in any format, RStudio tells me that there're some updates required for the package, and starts the downloading and installing processes. However, after that, there's still no preview be performed and when I click the preview button again, it promts me to do the downloading and installing again.
This hasn't been solved when I submitted the hw. And this also happens when I knit rmd files.

1. Still have to submit and push!  


## Reflections
### Reflection on GitHub
* Version management experience  
During my work in the game studio, we use PerForce, SVN, and AlienBrain for document and data management. Compared with them, GitHub was born for programming projects and I think it has a more supportive workflow in software dev than the general-use tools do.
* GitHub experience  
I tried to use GitHub when it got really popular in one or two years ago. I once tried using it to do some small personal projects with friends. But because we don't have a large team, with only 1 or 2 coders, I haven't been able to really get into the power of GitHub. Hope this is the course where I'm starting to know more about it.

### Reflection on the markdown
* General feeling  
It's text formatting tool Looks very like other markdown languages like HTML, but much loosely defined. (based on my limited programming experience)
* Hotkey for the format markdowns  
I hope there are some hot keys for different markdowns. I believe there are, maybe already integrated in RStudio, as a recommended IDE for R. I have to look into it!
