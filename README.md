Repository for first CFSS homework assignment
Oh man, so many steps. 

I'm going this twice, becaue I got confused last time. 



At first I edited the readme on the github website, I actually made two changes because last night I got confused halfway and had to take a break, and so this morning I am trying again and seeing if going through the steps makes more sense. I tried to use the clone link again in Rstudio, but it wouldn't let me because I had already made the hw01 project. Now I am editing the readme, although now that I'm thinking about it maybe that's why the changes I made online aren't showing up? I'm still a bit confused, but I am trying. Now I'm going to save these changes, commit them in the git tab, and then try and push them to the site.. Crossing my fingers.
