Repository for first CFSS homework assignment  

1. This is the repository of *Sean Coyne* for homework 01.  

2. In order to get this repository, I went to the [class website](https://uc-cfss.github.io/hw01_edit-README.html), forked the homework 1 repo. I looked online at your instructions on how to edit a file. Then in RStudio, I opened a new project, opened a new version control, then selected GIT, I then copied the "forked" url into the repository url box, and linked it to the folder for this class that I've created on my desktop. I chose to "open the project in a new window." This opened a new RStudio file in which the hw01.Rproj file as well as the README.md file which I am currently editing.  

3. After typing out my answer, I realized that I needed to experiment with the R Markdown. I therefore made edits by making the following 4 items in the readme file:  

*bold  

*italics  

*made a list  

*I linked a website  
4. After this, I'll check to make sure no one else made any changes to the master by using "pull." There shouldn't be any, and therefore I will commit the changes and note what changes I made, and then finally I will push the edits bcak using the "push" command.  
5. Finally I will create a pull request on Github in order to **turn in my homework assignment**.
