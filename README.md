# HW1
Repository for first CFSS homework assignment

##Personal Information
I am a second year PhD student in the sociology department. I'm broadly interested in economic and political sociology and theoretical debates in the sociology of knowledge. I'm in the early stages of a project examining regulatory variation of financial markets at the national level in response to the global diffusion of high-frequency trading infrastructure. I'm hoping some of the skills in this course can assist with data collection and analysis. 

##My Process
I attempted the “more powerful workflow” and overall it wasn’t so bad. I was having difficulties linking Git to my terminal but I went to see Josh and he helped me install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/index.html) which did the trick. This experience offered my first major computational lesson: trying to understand **by yourself** exactly why something isn’t working can quickly turn into a waste of time. Ask around for help and soon enough you’ll find someone who, even if they can’t diagnose the problem, can at least *fix* the problem. Get it working. Move on. 

###Workflow 
Here’s the summary of my workflow. The corresponding terminal commands follow each step below: 

*First I specified the destination on my laptop where I wanted the file to go*

  i) cd Desktop/Computation/

*I then cloned the HW1 repository in order to create a local copy of the file*

  ii) git clone https://github.com/rishigarora/hw01

*I opened the file in RStudio to edit it locally*

  iii) open README.md

*After saving the file, I committed the change and pushed it to my repository*  

  iv) git commit -m "Made change"

*I executed the pull request through the browser*

####Quick Tip
This [R Markdown Cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/rmarkdown-cheatsheet-2.0.pdf) was very helpful in learning the various markdown commands employed here (bold, italics, bullets, etc). I can definitely see how markdown could be a more efficient method than traditional word processing and I look forward to learning more tricks!
