# Homework 1
## Bobae Kang
  **Quick description of my work**
  1. Downloaded and installed Git and *RStudio*.
  2. On *Github*, folked the original to my repository.
  3. On *RStudio*, started a new version control project.
  4. Opened README.md on *RStudio* and made changes.
  5. Saved the changes and committed it.
  6. Pushed the changed README.md to *Github*.
  
  First I could not get through this homework because I did not know I had first to *folk* the repository to my [account](https://github.com/bobaekang/hw01)
