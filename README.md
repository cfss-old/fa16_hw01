# Assignment 1 #
## by Tong Ju ##

My name is Tong Ju, a student in MAPSS program. 

Before coming to Chicago, my research focused on the protein engineering and protein sulfation. Naturally, my interest in social science relies in  **sociology of science**. I intend to understand the conceptual evolution of biochemistry over history through using sociological tool.

Besides this, I am also interested in the **political sociology **, especially the historical memory of Chinese people in the  twentieth century.

*Other interests outside academic:*

* *reading*

* *guitar*

* *cooking*

* *movie*

>##Report of Process##
>In this assignment, I followed the following workflow:

>1. Folk the repository of the hw01 from uc-cfss/hw01;

>2. Clone the repository URL to the local R-studio;

>3. Edit the README.md in R-studio;

>4. Commit the edited README.md to my own Git with a commit message;

>5. Create a pull request and submit the final work to the uc-cfss/hw01.

>##Reflection##

>Fortunately, I was not confronted with any problem during installation of software. But it took me some time to understand how "fork/pull request" works and why we need to create a markdown version of file. Besides this, nothing more to say. Hopefully, the "Report of process" and this "Reflection" is what the instructor expects. Thank you.
