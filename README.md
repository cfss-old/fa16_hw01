Repository for first CFSS homework assignment

This is the repository of Yuhao Zhuang for Homework 01.

### Personal Information

I am Yuhao Zhuang, a second-year Sociology PhD student. My research interests include **organizations and institutions**, **state formation in authoritarian contexts**, and **qualitative and quantitative methods in the social sciences**. I attend this class to acquaint myself with *computational methods*, which could significantly help enrich data sources for my further research projects. [This](http://yuhaozhuang.weebly.com) is my personal website.

### Process and Reflections

For this assignment, I implemented the workflow as follows:

* Install software
+ Fork the repository
+ Clone the repository to my local Mac
+ Edit locally **README.md** in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics) and save it periodically
+ Commit the changes to the repository
+ Push the changes to GitHub
+ Generate a pull request on the original repository

From my perspective, the hardest part of the whole process was the software installation, particularly [Git personalization](https://uc-cfss.github.io/git03.html) and [Git and GitHub setup](https://uc-cfss.github.io/git04.html). I had to make sure that the commands I typed in shell were right. For instance, when determining where in my local file directory I would store my repositories, I made mistakes and then had to return to correct them according to the setup instructions. This process took quite a while. Everything else worked smoothly and well for me.

As to [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics), personally I *love* it and consider it as a convenient way to create documents and reports. For instance, if I want to italicize texts, I do not need to point and click in drop-down menus as in Microsoft Word but only need to type in asterisk symbols. For me it helps save more time and enhance work efficiency.
