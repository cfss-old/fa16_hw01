# Homework 1
This is the repository of James Marvel-Coen for homework 01.  

## Forking, Pulling, and Experimenting  

To get this repository, I went to the [class website](https://uc-cfss.github.io/) and navigated from there to the hw01 file repository.  I then forked the repo.  I played around with the file online, and looked at how to edit it there.  Then, I went to RStudio, used *File>New Project>Version Control>Git*, pasted the repo URL into the Repository URL space, named the project directory HW01, created the project as a subdirectory of the folder that will contain my files for this class, checked the "**Open in new window**"" box, and clicked "Create Project."  Now I am experimenting with the Markdown system.  I have added a hypterlink, headers, italicized text, bolded text, and made an ordered list.

## Turning Homework In  

After I write this, I will:  
1.  Save.  
2.  Pull, to make sure changes haven't been made remotely since I began editing.  
3.  Commit my changes  
4.  Make a note explaining what changes I'm committing.  
5.  Push the commit back to GitHub.  
6.  Create a pull request to turn in the homework.
