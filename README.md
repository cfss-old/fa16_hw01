# introduction
I'm Jongyoon from *South Korea*. This is my **first** year in political science ~~PhD~~ program. I used stata before, so R is a little bit difficult for me so far. But the step-by-step instructions on the main course webpage [link](https://uc-cfss.github.io/) helps me a lot.

# Reflections and experience

## Github
I expect github to be *super useful* for research, since growing numbers of works are done with **more than** one authors in academia. **However**, in the future, I wish the entry barrier to R, R studio, and Github to be *lower* than it is today.

## Process
'Using Git within RStudio'page was especially helpful. [link](https://uc-cfss.github.io/git05.html#step_2:_clone_the_new_github_repository_to_your_computer_via_rstudio)
### First,
I *copied* the URL of Readme.md, opend Rstudio, opened *File>New project>version control>git* and pasted the URL. I basically followed the direction on the link above.
### Second,
After clicking 'create project', ~~I did not know what to do at the first time~~. But then I found README.md file icon from the down-right window, and clicked it.
### Third,
And then I wanted to write down something. **R Markdown Reference Guide** helped me a lot to learn syntax. [link](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf)
### Last,
Hope I can save, commit, and push to GitHub successfully."This is Jongyoon's homework"
